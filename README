EPCOS' T5400 pressure sensor
----------------------------


This driver implements support for the T5400 digital pressure sensor from
EPCOS. The driver is interfaced through the input layer and reports
ABS_PRESSURE and ABS_MISC events. The ABS_PRESSURE event holds the pressure
data measured in Pascal. The ABS_MISC event reports the temperature in centi
Celsius.
